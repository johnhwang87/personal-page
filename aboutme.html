          <p class="bio">Once upon a time, a boy named John was born. He grew up like a normal kid (kind of), and wasn't weird at all. He was going through life trying to figure out his calling. So, he applied for college, and got a degree in psychology. Little did he know, he actually did not want to do anything with psychology... Perhaps being a teacher was his calling! How's about teaching abroad, in Korea? Turns out kids were quite the handful (although extremely rewarding), and he missed his friends and family too much to call the country Home. What about writing? John's always enjoyed it, and had some awesome screenplay ideas, but alas, no connections... Perhaps an office job was the right job for him. No. It was not. Maybe being a cop! Chasing bad guys, not sitting in front of a computer all day like a drone was very appealing to Mr. John. Then came a little bird who told him about his awesome job as a Web Developer. Casual workplace, collaboration, creation, all wrapped up in one giant, sexy burrito. John had to find out more. He did some research and went on <a href="http://www.codeacademy.com">CodeAcademy</a> and made his very first website! It was AMAZING! His eyes were wide open, and his thirst for knowledge (for the first time ever) was insatiable! He enrolled into General Assembly's Web Development Immersive program, and lost his life for 12 weeks, but thought it was totally worth it, because he has finally found his passion: Being a Web Developer. Mm. Please hire me.</p>
